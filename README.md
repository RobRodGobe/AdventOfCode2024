# AdventOfCode2024
My solutions for AoC for 2024, using C#, JavaScript, Python and Go

For C#:
The project runs under .NET 8, so that version of the SDK is a requirement. 
Modify Program.cs Main method to Console.WriteLine the desired Day(s). Then, on the terminal, under the csharp folder, run "dotnet run".

For JavaScript:
Node is required to run the JavaScript version. 
Modify AoC_2024.js main() function to console.log the desired Day(s). Then, on the terminal, under the javascript folder, run "node AoC_2024.js"

For Python:
Python3 is required to run. 
Modify AoC_2024.py main() function to print the desired Day(s). Then, on the terminal, under the python folder, run "python3 AoC_2024.py"

For Go:
Go version: go version go1.22.8 darwin/amd64
Modify AoC_2024.go main() function to fmt.Println the desired Day(s). Then, on the terminal, under the golang folder, run "go run main.go"
